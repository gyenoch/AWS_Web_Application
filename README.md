## AWS Project: Architect and Build an End to End AWS Web Application from¬†Scratch

This project is a simple Calculator web application built using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Amplify. It allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The user is expected to input three argument, two numbers and the type of math operation. When the equal button is clicked, the API gateway is called to trigger the lambda function which performs the calculation and as well store the result in the database. Later we get the result returned to us through the API gateway. The frontend is deployed using AWS Amplify, providing an intuitive interface for interacting with the backend Lambda functions.

## Overview
üõ†Ô∏è **Tools Explored:** 
AWS Amplify, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, AWS DynamoDB, AWS IAM

üìö **Key Concepts:**
- AWS Amplify to deploy and host our web application
- AWS Lambda to perform math operation
- AWS DynamoDB to store our math result
- AWS API Gateway to trigger the lambda function and return request
- AWS IAM to give permission to our lambda function to write to the database

## Contributing
